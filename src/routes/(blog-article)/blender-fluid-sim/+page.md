Watching water simulations are cool as hell. Being able to build a small world where you have water or other fluids 
interacting with that world is even cooler. I wanted to take a few moments to talk about how to make this in Blender.
Please note, I'm NOT going into how the particle/fluid simulation system in Blender actually works. I'm not nearly smart
enough for that. But I'm hoping that I can explain well enough which buttons to click in order to make something that 
looks cool.

## Let's go!

You'll need Blender 2.8 or newer.
