In my day job, I deal with things related to Application Security (AppSec) a lot.
One request that's been coming a lot from my customers, is for some ability to view SAST results (DAST and SCA too),
from within the CI/CD platform that runs their pipelines on GitHub.

In this post, I'll explain how you can do this.

(More to be added later)

[//]: # (Keep in mind, not everyone uses the same platform &#40;eg: platforms like Jenkins or Azure DevOps&#41; and every platform has)

[//]: # (their own limitations. In this post, I want to talk about three things:)

[//]: # (- List some of the more common CI/CD platforms)

[//]: # (- Tell you which platforms can handle the rendering/showing of SAST, DAST, and SCA results)

[//]: # (- Explain how you might be able to present your AppSec results in your CI/CD platform)
