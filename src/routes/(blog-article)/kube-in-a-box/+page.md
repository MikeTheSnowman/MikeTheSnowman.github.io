I have to deal with running a lot of POCs (proof-of-concept) projects from kubernetes (k8s).
While manually trying to stand up a k8s cluster from scratch is the most frustering thing in the world, getting one 
configured to be production ready and secure is an absolute nightmare. There's just too much to do with a very high
margin of error.

Thankfully, there are options out there to help you with getting a k8s cluster up and running.
